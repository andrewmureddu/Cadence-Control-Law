# Cadence Control Law (CCL)

The Cadence Control Law states:  
*A heterogeneous system achieves maximum persistence when its members rotate roles in a repeating cadence, such that no member is permanently confined to either high-stress or low-stress duty.*

This repository preserves the law itself as public knowledge. Implementations (such as the Cadence Battery Controller) are handled separately and may be subject to patent protection.
