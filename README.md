# Cadence Control Law

The **Cadence Control Law (CCL)** is a systems principle describing how heterogeneous modules (energy, biological, computational, or social) achieve persistence.  

> A heterogeneous system achieves maximum persistence when its constituent modules cyclically exchange roles of capacity, alignment, and response in a fixed cadence, thereby suppressing differential stress and synchronizing degradation.
