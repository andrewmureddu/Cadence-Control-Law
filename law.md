# The Cadence Control Law

**Statement:**  
A heterogeneous system achieves maximum persistence when its members rotate roles in a repeating cadence, such that no member is permanently confined to either high-stress or low-stress duty.

**Key roles (abstract):**  
- **Bulk** — steady carriers of load.  
- **Alignment** — stabilizers and synchronizers.  
- **Sprinters** — absorbers of spikes and initiators of change.

This principle generalizes across domains: energy storage, compute scheduling, biological systems, and economic ensembles.
