# The Cadence Control Law

**Formal Statement**  
A heterogeneous system achieves maximum persistence when its members rotate roles in a repeating cadence, such that no member is permanently confined to either high-stress or low-stress duty.

## Expanded Definition
The Cadence Control Law formalizes the principle that endurance in complex systems does not arise from static allocation of roles, but from rhythmic rotation. By ensuring each member alternates between phases of stress-bearing and recovery, the ensemble sustains itself beyond the limits of any single part. Cadence converts fragility into persistence by distributing load, recovery, and synchronization across time.

## Generalized Roles
- **Bulk** — steady carriers of load.  
  *Examples:* baseline processes in computing; organs maintaining homeostasis in biology; long-term investments in economics.  

- **Alignment** — stabilizers and synchronizers.  
  *Examples:* system clocks in computing; enzymes regulating reactions in biology; monetary policy in economics.  

- **Sprinters** — absorbers of shocks and initiators of bursts.  
  *Examples:* interrupt handlers in computing; immune responses in biology; liquidity injections in economics.  

Together, these roles maintain balance. Persistence requires that no role remain fixed to a single member; each must rotate through the cycle.

## Universal Applications
The cadence principle generalizes across domains:

- **Energy Systems** — multi-chemistry packs where modules trade roles to extend life.  
- **Computing** — orchestrating processes in cadence to balance throughput and latency.  
- **Biology** — cellular and organ rhythms alternating stress and rest phases.  
- **Economics** — markets rotating through cycles of growth, stabilization, and liquidity.
